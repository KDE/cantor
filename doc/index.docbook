<title>Description
</title>
<para><function>XtUnmanageChildren()</function> unmaps the specified widgets
and removes them from their parent's geometry management.
The widgets will disappear from the screen, and (depending
on its parent) may no longer have screen space allocated for
them.
</para>
<para>Each of the widgets in the <replaceable class="parameter">children</replaceable> array must have
the same parent.

<para>See the &ldquo;Algorithm&rdquo; section below for full details of the
widget unmanagement procedure.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id="r1-1007-unmanagechildren-2">
<title>Usage</title>
<para>Unmanaging widgets is the usual method for temporarily
making them invisible.  They can be re-managed with
<function>XtManageChildren()</function>.
</para>
<para>You can unmap a widget, but leave it under geometry
management by calling <function>XtUnmapWidget()</function>.  You can
destroy a widget's window without destroying the widget by
calling <function>XtUnrealizeWidget()</function>.  You can destroy a
widget completely with <function>XtDestroyWidget()</function>.
</para>
<para>If you are only going to unmanage a single widget, it is
more convenient to call <function>XtUnmanageChild()</function>.  It is
often more convenient to call <function>XtUnmanageChild()</function>
several times than it is to declare and initialize an array
of widgets to pass to <function>XtUnmanageChildren()</function>.  Calling
<function>XtUnmanageChildren()</function> is more efficient, however,
because it only calls the parent's <function>change_managed()</function>
method once.
</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id="r1-1007-unmanagechildren-3">
<title>Algorithm
