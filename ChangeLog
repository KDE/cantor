-----19.04-----

New Features:
    * Possibility to hide and show results of command entry via context menu
    * [Maxima, Octave, Python, R] Add a way to specify the path to the local documentation in the settings. By default, this path didn't specified and Cantor uses online documentation.
    * Huge improvment of variables managment: better parsing, option to turn on and turn off variable managment, better GUI performance by limitation of value size (too big for showing values replaced by "<too big variable>" text

Important bug fixes:
	* [Sage] Fix execuation for unsystem Sage installation
	* [Julia] Fix bug, that suppressing output don't work
