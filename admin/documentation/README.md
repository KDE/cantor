This folder contains instructions and helper scripts to convert the documentation of the different languages (usually in HTML) to [QtHelp format](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qthelp-framework.html).

Once the documentation in the QtHelp format is ready, it needs to be uploaded together with a screenshot and a short description to the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/browse?cat=650&ord=latest).
