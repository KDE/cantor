### Steps for adding custom style to the Qalculate documentation

1. Copy and paste the main.css file as it is in the Qalculate folder.

2. Link this file with the HTML files of Qalculte Documentation.

3. This can be done by running the `script.py` file. 

4. Using this main.css file one can customize the Qalculte Documentation by adding custom css rules in it.

5. Along with that `script.py` will also run the code for converting the Qalculate documentation in Qt Help files.
