So it is likely, and there is growing evidence that this is the case, that the first form of replicating life was RNA.

Current approaches achieve more accurate solutions by using energy models based one experimental values to then obtain a structure that minimizes free energy. But since we're not really concerned with the accuracy of our predictions, Nussinov is a good entry point. Furthermore, the main algorithmic concepts are the same between Nussinov and state of the art RNA structure prediction algorithms. I implemented the algorithm in a separate file called `fold.py` that we can import and use its functions. I'm not going to go into detail here on how the algorithm works because it is beyond the scope of this workshop but there is a bonus exercise at the end if you're curious.\n"

        "Now that we have a good way of getting a phenotype (secondary structure), we need a way to evaluate the fitness of that phenotype. If we think in real life terms, fitness is the ability of a genotype to replicate into the next generation. If you have a gene carrying a mutation that causes some kind of disease, your fitness is decreased and you have a lower chance of contributing offspring to the next generation. On a molecular level the same concept applies. A molecule needs to accomplish a certain function, i.e. bind to some other molecule or send some kind of signal. And as we've seen before, the most important factor that determines how well it can carry out this function is its structure. So we can imagine that a certain structure, we can call this a 'target' structure, is required in order to accomplish a certain function. So a sequence that folds correctly to a target structure is seen as having a greater fitness than one that does not. Since we've encoded structures as simple dot-bracket strings, we can easily compare structures and thus evaluate the fitness between a given structure and the target, or 'correct' structure. \n"

Go to the [MUSCLE Web Server](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) and give it the `seq.fasta` file. It will take a few seconds and it will give you an alignment and click *Download Alignment File*, copy paste the whole thing to a new file called `aln.clustal`. This is the alignment we will use to build our tree."

This could be in the form of selective pressure, mating preference, genetic drift, mutations, gene flow, etc. So in order to detect if something like this is happening we need to develop a test. This is where Hardy Weinberg comes in. \n"

For example, we can look at locus number **5** (position 5 in our RNA sequences) and call reference **C**, and alternate **G**. If we are in HW we can predict the frequency of each allele in our population.\n"

Since we are dealing with diploid populations, each individual will have two copies of each locus so it can be $p_{AA}, p{Aa}, p{aA}, p{aa}$.

Specifically, it is the probability of observing a value equal to or more extreme than that our statistic given the test distribution. So in our case, it is the probability of observing a $X^2$ greater than or equal to the one the test gives us under a $\\chi^2$ distribution. When this value is very small, it suggests that it is unlikely that we are sampling from our assumed 'null' distribution and that some other alternate distribution is the true distribution. So a low p-value here would be evidence against the neutral Hardy Weinberg model and would suggest that our population is experiencing some influences such as mating preference, selection, mutation etc.\n"

However, very often the p-value does not give us the whole story and we need to know about things like sample size, size of impact, reproducibility, power of the test, etc. (check this out [American Statistical Association statement on p-values](http://www.nature.com/news/statisticians-issue-warning-over-misuse-of-p-values-1.19503), [p-hacking](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1), and [this](http://allendowney.blogspot.ca/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html))\n"

        "Once we find that our population strays from the HW condition we can begin to ask why that is the case. Often this deviation from the expected allele frequencies under HW is due to mating preference. Hardy Weinberg assumes that all individuals in a population have an equal probability of mating with any other individual (random mating). However, when certain individuals prefer to mate with specific others (in real populations this can be due to culture, race, geographic barriers, etc.), you get what is known as population structure. Population structure means that we begin to see *sub-populations* within our total population where individuals prefer to mate within their sub-population. This biased mating will result in a higher number of homozygotes than we would expect under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Simply because mating preferences will tend to drive populations toward similar genotypes. So if this is the case, and no other factors are biasing allele dynamics, within sub-populations we should have Hardy-Weinberg like conditions. \n"

        "This approach is based on the principle of parsimony, which states that the simplest explanation for our data is the most likely to be true. So given an alignment, we assume that the best tree is the one that minimizes the number of changes, or mutations. This is often a reasonable assumption to make since mutation rates in real populations are generally low, and things like back-mutations (e.g. A --> C --> A) are unlikely. Computing the tree that that maximizes parsimony directly is a difficult task, but evaluating the parsimony score of a tree given the tree is easy. So this approach basically generates many random trees for the data and scores them based on parsimony keeping the most parsimonious tree. Take a look at [the biopython manual to work through this example](http://biopython.org/wiki/Phylo), and [this one](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Phylo.TreeConstruction.ParsimonyTreeConstructor-class.html).\n"

How do we know our tree is a good representation of the data? By 'good' here we will instead use the word 'robust'. Is the tree we use too sensitive to the particularities of the data we gave it? If we make a small change in the sequence will we get a very different tree? Normally these problems would be addressed by re-sampling and seeing if we obtain similar results. But we can't really re-sample evolution. It happened once and we can't make it happen again. So we use something called *bootstrapping* which is a technique often used in statistics where instead of generating new data, you re-sample from your present data.\n"

        "\n"
        "There are several approaches for solving this problem, we will look at the simplest one here which is known as the Nussinov Algorithm. This algorithm is a popular example of a class of algorithms know as dynamic programming algorithms. The main idea behind these algorithms is that we can break down the problem into many subproblems which are easier to compute than the full problem. Once we have obtained the solution for the subproblems, we can retrieve the solution to the full problem by doing something called a backtrace (more on the backtrace later). \n"
        "\n"
        "Here, the problem is obtaining the optimal pairing on a string of nucleotides. In order to know how good our structure is, we assign a score to it. One possible scoring scheme could be adding 1 to the score per paired set of nucleotides, and 0 otherwise. So in other words, we want a pairing that will give us the highest possible score. We can write this quantity as $OPT(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ are the indices of the sequence between which we obtain the pairing score. Our algorithm is therefore going to compute a folding score for all substrings bound by $i$ and $j$ and store the value in what is known as a dynamic programming table. Our dynamic programming table will be a $N$ x $N$ array where $N$ is the length of our sequence. So now that we have a way of measuring how good a structure is, we need a way to evaluate scores given a subsequence. To do this, we set some rules on the structure of an RNA sequence:\n"
        "\n"
        "\n"
        "If $i$ and $j$ form a pair:\n"
        "1. The pair $i$ and $j$ must form a valid watson-crick pair.\n"
        "2. $i < j-4$. This ensures that bonding is not happening between positions that are too close to each other, which would produce steric clashes.\n"
        "3. If pair $(i,j)$ and $(k, l)$ are in the structure, then $i < k < j < l$. This ensures that there is no crossing over of pairs which would result in pseudoknots.\n"
        "4. No base appears in more than one pair.\n"
        "\n"
        "Using these rules we can begin to build our algorithm. The first part of our algorithm needs to take as input indices $i$ and $j$ and return the value $OPT(i,j)$ which is the optimal score of a structure between $i$ and $j$. We start by thinking about values of $i$ and $j$ for which we can immediately know the solution, this is known as a 'base case'.  This is a case where the solution is known and no further recursion is required. Once the algorithm reaches the base case, it can return a solution and propagate it upward to the first recursive call. So once we have reached $i$ and $j$ that are too close to form a structure (rule number 2), we know that the score is 0. \n"
        "\n"
        "Otherwise, we must weigh the possibility of forming a pair or not forming a pair. If $i$ and $j$ are unpaired, then $OPT(i,j)$ is just $OPT(i, j-1)$ since the score will not increase for unpaired indices. \n"
        "\n"
        "The other case is that $i$ is paired to some index $t$ on the interval $[i,j]$. We then add 1 to the score and consider the structure formed before and after the pairing between $i$ and $t$. We can write these two cases as $OPT(i, t-1)$ and $OPT(t+1, j)$. But how do we know which $t$ to pair $i$ with? Well we simply try all possible values of $t$ within the allowed range and choose the best one. \n"
        "\n"
        "All of this can be summed up as follows:\n"
        "\n"
        "$$ OPT(i,j) = max\\begin{cases}\n"
        "                OPT(i, j-1) \\quad \\text{If $i$ and $j$ are not paired with each other.}\\\\\n"
        "                max(1 + OPT(i, t-1) + OPT(t+1, j)) \\quad \\text{Where we try all values of $t$ < j - 4}\n"
        "                \\end{cases}$$\n"
        "\n"
        "\n"
        "We can now use this recursion to fill our dynamic programming table. Once we have filled the table with scores, we can retrieve the optimal folding by a process called backtracking. We won't go into detail on how this works, but the main idea is that we can start by looking at the entry containing the score for the full sequence $OPT[0][N]$. We can then look at adjacent entries and deduce which case (pairing or not pairing) resulted in the current value. We can continue like this for the full table until we have retrieved the full structure."

Both cues are associated with a likelihood function indicating the probability of that cue for all possible locations of the snake.

The auditory cue is easier to localize, so its associated likelihood function, $p(c_\\mathrm{A}|s)$, is sharper. In accordance with Bayes' Rule, and assuming a flat prior over the snake's location, an optimal estimate of the location of the snake can be computed by multiplying the two likelihoods.

        "It has been shown behaviorally that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference on ambiguous sensory information. As suggested by Ma *et. al.* (2006) and shown here, it is possible that the brain does this operation by simply performing linear combinations of populations of Poisson neurons receiving various sensory input. Cortical neurons may be particularly well suited for this task because they have Poisson-like firing rates, displaying reliable variability from trial to trial (Tolhurst, Movshon & Dean, 1982; Softky & Koch, 1993).\n"
        "\n"
        "High levels of noise in these populations might at first be difficult to reconcile considering highly precise behavioral data. However, variability in neural populations might be direcly representative of uncertainty in environmental stimuli. Variability in cortical populations would then be critical for precise neural coding.\n"

Consequently, the position and orientation of a rigid body can be completely described by a corresponding coordinate system attached to it. For instance, two (or more) coordinate systems can be used to represent the same rigid body at two (or more) instants or two (or more) rigid bodies in space.\n"

Furthermore, one can define an additional coordinate system called technical coordinate system also fixed at the rigid body but not based on anatomical landmarks. In this case, the position of the technical markers is first described in the laboratory coordinate system, and then the technical coordinate system is calculated to recreate the anatomical landmarks position in order to finally calculate the original anatomical coordinate system (and obtain its unknown position and orientation through time).\n"
