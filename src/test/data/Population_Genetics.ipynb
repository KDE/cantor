    "## Population Genetics in *an* RNA World\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to study population genetics, we first need a model of a population. And even before that, we need to define what we mean by *population*. Populations can be defined on many levels and with many diffferent criteria. For our purposes, we will simply say that a population is a set of individuals sharing a common environment. And because this is population *genetics* we can think of individuals as entities comprising of specific genes or chromosomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So where do we get a population from? As you may have discussed in previous workshops, there are very large datasets containing sequencing information from different populations. So we could download one of these datasets and perform some analysis on it. But I find this can be dry and tedious. So why download data when we can simply create our own?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we're going to be creating and studying our own \"artificial\" populations to illustrate some important population genetics concepts and methodologies. Not only will this help you learn population genetics, but you will get a lot more programming practice than if we were to simply parse data files and go from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we're going to build our own RNA world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, RNA is widely thought to be the first self replicating life-form to arise x billion years ago. One of the strongest arguments for this theory is that RNA is able to carry information in its nucleotides like DNA, and like protein, it is able to adopt higher order structures to catalyze reactions, such as self replication. So it is likely, and there is growing evidence that this is the case, that the first form of replicating life was RNA. And because of this dual property of RNA as an information vessel as well as a structural/functional element we can use RNA molecules to build very nice population models. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in this notebook, I'll be walking you through building genetic populations, simulating their evolution, and using statistics and other mathematical tools for understanding key properties of populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building an RNA population\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, RNA has the nice property of posessing a strong mapping between information carrying (sequence) and function (structure). This is analogous to what is known in evolutionary terms as a genotype and a phenotype. With these properties, we have everything we need to model a population, and simulate its evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RNA sequence-structure\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the genotype as a sequence $s$ consisting of letters/nucleotides from the alphabet $\\{U,A,C,G\\}$. The corresponding phenotype $\\omega$ is the secondary structure of $s$ which can be thought of as a pairing between nucleotides in the primary sequence that give rise to a 2D architecture. Because it has been shown that the function of many biomolecules, including RNA, is driven by structure this gives us a good proxy for phenotype. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of what an RNA secondary structure, or pairing, looks like."

    "As you can see, unparied positions are forming loop-like structures, and paired positions are forming stem-like structures. It is this spatial arrangement of nucleotides that drives RNA's function. Therefore, another sequence that adopts a similar shape, is likely to behave in a similar manner. Another thing to notice is that, although in reality this is often not the case, in general we only allow pairs between $\\{C,G\\}$ and $\\{A, U\\}$ nucleotides, most modern approaches allow for non-canonical pairings and you will find some examples of this in the above structure.\n",

    "The algorithm we're going to be using in our simulations is known as the Nussinov Algorithm. The Nussinov algorithm is one of the first and simplest attempts at predicting RNA structure. Because bonds tend to stabilize RNA, the algorithm tries to maximize the number of pairs in the structure and return that as its solution. Current approaches achieve more accurate solutions by using energy models based one experimental values to then obtain a structure that minimizes free energy. But since we're not really concerned with the accuracy of our predictions, Nussinov is a good entry point. Furthermore, the main algorithmic concepts are the same between Nussinov and state of the art RNA structure prediction algorithms. I implemented the algorithm in a separate file called `fold.py` that we can import and use its functions. I'm not going to go into detail here on how the algorithm works because it is beyond the scope of this workshop but there is a bonus exercise at the end if you're curious.\n",

    "### Fitness of a sequence: Target Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a good way of getting a phenotype (secondary structure), we need a way to evaluate the fitness of that phenotype. If we think in real life terms, fitness is the ability of a genotype to replicate into the next generation. If you have a gene carrying a mutation that causes some kind of disease, your fitness is decreased and you have a lower chance of contributing offspring to the next generation. On a molecular level the same concept applies. A molecule needs to accomplish a certain function, i.e. bind to some other molecule or send some kind of signal. And as we've seen before, the most important factor that determines how well it can carry out this function is its structure. So we can imagine that a certain structure, we can call this a 'target' structure, is required in order to accomplish a certain function. So a sequence that folds correctly to a target structure is seen as having a greater fitness than one that does not. Since we've encoded structures as simple dot-bracket strings, we can easily compare structures and thus evaluate the fitness between a given structure and the target, or 'correct' structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to compare structures $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$, but we're going to use one of the simplest ways, which is base-pair distance. This is just the number of pairs in $w_{1}$ that are not in $w_{2}$. Again, this is beyond the scope of this workshop so I'll just give you the code for it and if you would like to know more you can ask me."

    "## Introducing diversity: Mutations\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolution would go nowhere without random mutations. While mutations are technically just random errors in the copying of genetic material, they are essential in the process of evolution. This is because they introduce novel diversity to populatons, which with a low frequency can be beneficial. And when a beneficial mutation arises (i.e. a mutation that increases fitness, or replication probability) it quickly takes over the population and the populatioin as a whole has a higher fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing mutations in our model will be quite straightforward. Since mutations happen at the genotype/sequence level, we simply have to iterate through our strings of nucleotides (sequences) and randomly introduce changes."

    "The final process in this evolution model is selection. Once you have populations with a diverse range of fitnesses, we need to select the fittest individuals and let them replicate and contribute offspring to the next generation. In real populations this is just the process of reproduction. If you're fit enough you will be likely to reproduce more than another individual who is not as well suited to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent this process in our model, we will use the fitness values that we assigned to each Cell earlier and use that to select replicating Cells. This is equivalent to sampling from a population with the sampling being weighted by the fitness of each Cell. Thankfully, `numpy.random.choice` comes to the rescue here. Once we have sampled enough Cells to build our next generation, we introduce mutations and compute the fitness values of the new generation."

    "This is basically a clustering method based on the distance (or number of differences) between every pair of sequences. It assumes that sequences that are more similar are more likely to be related than the other way around. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ sequences, the algorithm builds an $NxN$ matrix that stores the distance between each sequence to every other sequence. The algorithm goes through this matrix and finds the pair of sequences that is most similar and merges it into a 'cluster' or in tree terms, connects them to a common node. This process is repeated until all the sequences have been assigned to a group. Refer to the wikipedia article on [UPGMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA) for a more detailed explanation. \n"

We can do this through BioPython but it requires some installation and setup so we will skip that for now. Go to the [MUSCLE Web Server](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) and give it the `seq.fasta` file. It will take a few seconds and it will give you an alignment and click *Download Alignment File*, copy paste the whole thing to a new file called `aln.clustal`.

    "## Introducing mating to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The populations we generated evolved asexually. This means that individuals do not mate or exchange genetic information. So to make our simulation a bit more interesting let's let the Cells mate. This is going to require a few small changes in the `selection()` function. Previously, when we selected sequences to go into the next generation we just let them provide one offspring which was a copy of itself and introduced mutations. Now instead of choosing one Cell at a time, we will randomly choose two 'parents' that will mate. When they mate, each parent will contribute one of its chromosomes to the child. We'll repeat this process until we have filled the next generation."

    "## Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are presented with data from a population we don't know much about. It is often useful to try to learn whether there are any evolutionary or behavioural influences that are shaping population dynamics. This could be in the form of selective pressure, mating preference, genetic drift, mutations, gene flow, etc. So in order to detect if something like this is happening we need to develop a test. This is where Hardy Weinberg comes in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Hardy Weinberg equilibrium states that \"allele and genotype frequencies remain constant in the absence of other evolutionary influences. (such as the ones we mentioned above)\" - Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we can measure allele/genotype frequencies (which we can do because we have sequences), we can see whether the HW principle holds true. If it does not, then we can do more digging to see what could be happening to shift populations away from equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this we need to define an 'allele'. An allele (for our purproses) will be a locus (position in a sequence) that can take one of two states, a *reference* state or an *alternate* state. For example, we can look at locus number **5** (position 5 in our RNA sequences) and call reference **C**, and alternate **G**. If we are in HW we can predict the frequency of each allele in our population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify our notation we will call the alternate allele *A* and the reference allele *a*. We can write the probability of each allele as $p_{A} + p_{a} = 1$. Since we are dealing with diploid populations, each individual will have two copies of each locus so it can be $p_{AA}, p{Aa}, p{aA}, p{aa}$. By simple probability laws we can get an expression for the probability of each genotype based on the probabilities of the single loci $p_{a}$ and $p_{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{aa}\\simeq p_{a}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{AA}\\simeq p_{A}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{Aa,~aA} \\simeq 2 p_{a} p_{A}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is hard to know what the true probability of observing either $p_{a}$ and $p_{A}$ we can estimate this probability from our data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat p_a=\\frac{2N_{aa}+N_{aA}}{2N}=1-\\hat p_A.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $N$ denotes the number of each genotype that we observe in our sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these estimates we can expect the following frequencies for each genotype: \n",
    "\n",
    "$N_{aa}\\simeq e_{aa}=N \\hat p_a^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_{AA}\\simeq e_{AA}= N \\hat p_{A}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_{Aa,~aA} \\simeq e_{Aa} = 2 N \\hat p_{a} \\hat p_{A}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have expected values, and observed values. We need a test to determine whether we have a significant departure from the hypothesis of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The statistical test that is commonly used is known as the $\\chi^{2}$ test. If you take a look at the equation you'll see that the statistic simply takes the squared difference between our observed value and the expected value (divided by expected) and sums this for each possible genotype. The reason we take the squared difference is because we want to deal only with positive values, hence the name $\\chi^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X^2= \\frac{(N_{aa}-e_{aa})^2}{e_{aa}}+ \\frac{(N_{Aa}-e_{Aa})^2}{e_{Aa}}+ \\frac{(N_{AA}-e_{AA})^2}{e_{AA}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is get alleles from our sequence data. This boils down to going through each sequence at the position of interest and counting the number of $AA$, $Aa$, $aa$ we get.\n",

    "## A brief interlude on the p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a minute to understand what the p-value means. The p-value is a probability. Specifically, it is the probability of observing a value equal to or more extreme than that our statistic given the test distribution. So in our case, it is the probability of observing a $X^2$ greater than or equal to the one the test gives us under a $\\chi^2$ distribution. When this value is very small, it suggests that it is unlikely that we are sampling from our assumed 'null' distribution and that some other alternate distribution is the true distribution. So a low p-value here would be evidence against the neutral Hardy Weinberg model and would suggest that our population is experiencing some influences such as mating preference, selection, mutation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of research bases its conclusions solely on p-value and it is important to be very wary of this bad practice. It has become a bad convention that people say a p-value lower than some arbitrary threshold means one's findings are significant. However, very often the p-value does not give us the whole story and we need to know about things like sample size, size of impact, reproducibility, power of the test, etc. (check this out [American Statistical Association statement on p-values](http://www.nature.com/news/statisticians-issue-warning-over-misuse-of-p-values-1.19503), [p-hacking](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1), and [this](http://allendowney.blogspot.ca/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just visualize this very quickly using the $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution. You will see that the p-value corresponds to the shaded red area under the curve. That area is the probability of observing a value as extreme or more than the one we found. When that is a very small area, we can be more confident that our assumption of HW is false."

    "## Population structure: F-statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic we'll cover is F-statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find that our population strays from the HW condition we can begin to ask why that is the case. Often this deviation from the expected allele frequencies under HW is due to mating preference. Hardy Weinberg assumes that all individuals in a population have an equal probability of mating with any other individual (random mating). However, when certain individuals prefer to mate with specific others (in real populations this can be due to culture, race, geographic barriers, etc.), you get what is known as population structure. Population structure means that we begin to see *sub-populations* within our total population where individuals prefer to mate within their sub-population. This biased mating will result in a higher number of homozygotes than we would expect under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Simply because mating preferences will tend to drive populations toward similar genotypes. So if this is the case, and no other factors are biasing allele dynamics, within sub-populations we should have Hardy-Weinberg like conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Raptors fans prefer to mate with other Raptors fans, then when we consider only Raptors fans, we should observe random mating. Simply because if the mating preference criterion is 'being a Raptor's fan' then any Raptor's fan will be equally likely to mate with any other Raptor's fan so we have Hardy Weinberg again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's express this in quantities we can measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "From before we calculated the observed and expected number of heterozygotes in a population. Let's call these $\\hat H$ and $H_{IT}$ respectively. $\\hat H$ is just the count of heterozygotes, and $H_{IT}$ is the same as the expected number of heterozygotes we calculated earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a quantity $e_{IT}$ as a measure of the 'excess heterozygosity' in the population when we consider all individuals $I$ in the total population $T$. $e_{IT} > 1$ when we have more heterozygotes than we expect under HW. And $0 < e_{IT} < 1$ if we have less heterozygotes than we would expect under HW.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e_{IT}=\\frac{\\mbox{observed proportion of hets}}{\\mbox{expected proportion of hets}}=\\frac{ H_{obs}}{H_{IT}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $e_{IT}$ to define the statistic $F_{IT}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{IT}=1-e_{IT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $F_{IT} > 0$ when we have a lack of heterozygotes and $F_{IT} < 0$ when we have an excess of heterozygotes. $F_{IT} = 0$ under random mating.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a subpropulation $S$ we can calculate the equivalent quantity but instead of considering heterozygosity in the whole population we only take a sub-population into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e_{IS} = \\frac{H_{obs}}{H_{IS}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, we have $F_{ST}$. This one is not as intuitive to derive so I'm not including the derivation here. But basically it measure the excess heterozygosity in the total population due to the presence of two subpopulations with allele frequencies $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{ST}= \\frac{(p_1-p_2)^2}{4 p (1-p)}$$"

    "Modify the `selection_with_mating()` function to allow for mating preferences within a population. In our example above we were just running two independent simulations to study barriers to gene flow. But now you will implement mating preferences within a single simulation. Your function will assign each Cell a new attribute called `self.preference` which will take a string value denoting the mating type the current cell prefers to mate with. For example we can have a population with three mating types: $\\{A, B, C\\}$. Your function will randomly assign preferences to each cell in the initial population. We will define a preference between types $A$ and $B$ as the probability that two cells of those given types will mate if selected. \n",

    "*Exercise 1.  Make a tree using maximum parsimony.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how to make trees using a distance score. Another popular method is known as the maximum parsimony approach. I won't go into too much detail on this since we are short on time, but I will give a quick intro and we'll look at how ot make a tree using maximum parsimony.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is based on the principle of parsimony, which states that the simplest explanation for our data is the most likely to be true. So given an alignment, we assume that the best tree is the one that minimizes the number of changes, or mutations. This is often a reasonable assumption to make since mutation rates in real populations are generally low, and things like back-mutations (e.g. A --> C --> A) are unlikely. Computing the tree that that maximizes parsimony directly is a difficult task, but evaluating the parsimony score of a tree given the tree is easy. So this approach basically generates many random trees for the data and scores them based on parsimony keeping the most parsimonious tree. Take a look at [the biopython manual to work through this example](http://biopython.org/wiki/Phylo), and [this one](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Phylo.TreeConstruction.ParsimonyTreeConstructor-class.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have an alignment (`aln.clustal`) we will just re-use it and make a maximum parsimony tree instead. "

    "*Exercise 2. Bootstrapping*\n",
    "\n",
    "We just saw two methods of growing phylogenetic trees given an alignment. However, as we saw with the maximum parsimony approach, there can be many different trees for a single data set. How do we know our tree is a good representation of the data? By 'good' here we will instead use the word 'robust'. Is the tree we use too sensitive to the particularities of the data we gave it? If we make a small change in the sequence will we get a very different tree? Normally these problems would be addressed by re-sampling and seeing if we obtain similar results. But we can't really re-sample evolution. It happened once and we can't make it happen again. So we use something called *bootstrapping* which is a technique often used in statistics where instead of generating new data, you re-sample from your present data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a multiple sequence alignment with $M$ sequences (rows) each with sequences of length $N$ nucleotides (columns). For each row, we can randomly sample $N$ nucleotides with replacement to make a new 'bootstrapped' sequence also of length $N$. Think of it as a kind of shuffling of the data. This gives us a whole new alignment that we can again use to make a new tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated many times to obtain many trees. The differences in topology (shape/structure) of the trees we obtained are assessed. If after this shuffling/perturbations we still get similar enough looking trees we can say that our final tree is robust to small changes in the data. ([some more reading on this](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1063994979))\n",

    "Let's run a small example of this using the bootstrapping functions in `BioPython`."

We can use this to revisit a the first programming question in the exercsies section. Does mutation rate and population size have an effect on the fitness of populations? We can translate this question to, is there a difference in the mean base pair distance between populations under different mutation and population size regimes?\n",

    "1. *Nussinov Algorithm (Only try this if you are feeling brave and are done with the other exercises or are interested in getting a taste of Computer Science. It is beyond the scope of this workshop.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches for solving this problem, we will look at the simplest one here which is known as the Nussinov Algorithm. This algorithm is a popular example of a class of algorithms know as dynamic programming algorithms. The main idea behind these algorithms is that we can break down the problem into many subproblems which are easier to compute than the full problem. Once we have obtained the solution for the subproblems, we can retrieve the solution to the full problem by doing something called a backtrace (more on the backtrace later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the problem is obtaining the optimal pairing on a string of nucleotides. In order to know how good our structure is, we assign a score to it. One possible scoring scheme could be adding 1 to the score per paired set of nucleotides, and 0 otherwise. So in other words, we want a pairing that will give us the highest possible score. We can write this quantity as $OPT(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ are the indices of the sequence between which we obtain the pairing score. Our algorithm is therefore going to compute a folding score for all substrings bound by $i$ and $j$ and store the value in what is known as a dynamic programming table. Our dynamic programming table will be a $N$ x $N$ array where $N$ is the length of our sequence. So now that we have a way of measuring how good a structure is, we need a way to evaluate scores given a subsequence. To do this, we set some rules on the structure of an RNA sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $i$ and $j$ form a pair:\n",
    "1. The pair $i$ and $j$ must form a valid watson-crick pair.\n",
    "2. $i < j-4$. This ensures that bonding is not happening between positions that are too close to each other, which would produce steric clashes.\n",
    "3. If pair $(i,j)$ and $(k, l)$ are in the structure, then $i < k < j < l$. This ensures that there is no crossing over of pairs which would result in pseudoknots.\n",
    "4. No base appears in more than one pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these rules we can begin to build our algorithm. The first part of our algorithm needs to take as input indices $i$ and $j$ and return the value $OPT(i,j)$ which is the optimal score of a structure between $i$ and $j$. We start by thinking about values of $i$ and $j$ for which we can immediately know the solution, this is known as a 'base case'.  This is a case where the solution is known and no further recursion is required. Once the algorithm reaches the base case, it can return a solution and propagate it upward to the first recursive call. So once we have reached $i$ and $j$ that are too close to form a structure (rule number 2), we know that the score is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we must weigh the possibility of forming a pair or not forming a pair. If $i$ and $j$ are unpaired, then $OPT(i,j)$ is just $OPT(i, j-1)$ since the score will not increase for unpaired indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other case is that $i$ is paired to some index $t$ on the interval $[i,j]$. We then add 1 to the score and consider the structure formed before and after the pairing between $i$ and $t$. We can write these two cases as $OPT(i, t-1)$ and $OPT(t+1, j)$. But how do we know which $t$ to pair $i$ with? Well we simply try all possible values of $t$ within the allowed range and choose the best one. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this can be summed up as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ OPT(i,j) = max\\begin{cases}\n",
    "                OPT(i, j-1) \\quad \\text{If $i$ and $j$ are not paired with each other.}\\\\\n",
    "                max(1 + OPT(i, t-1) + OPT(t+1, j)) \\quad \\text{Where we try all values of $t$ < j - 4}\n",
    "                \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use this recursion to fill our dynamic programming table. Once we have filled the table with scores, we can retrieve the optimal folding by a process called backtracking. We won't go into detail on how this works, but the main idea is that we can start by looking at the entry containing the score for the full sequence $OPT[0][N]$. We can then look at adjacent entries and deduce which case (pairing or not pairing) resulted in the current value. We can continue like this for the full table until we have retrieved the full structure."
